# Acne-Grading-Classifier

The "Acne Grading Classifier using CNN" project with three severity levels involves creating a system to automatically classify images of acne into three distinct levels based on their severity using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Acne severity is commonly categorized into mild, moderate, and severe stages.

In this project, CNNs, a type of deep learning model well-suited for image-related tasks, are employed to automatically learn and extract features from the input images that are indicative of different severity levels. The project requires a labeled dataset consisting of images representing each severity level for training the neural network.

During the training process, the CNN learns to recognize patterns and features associated with mild, moderate, and severe acne. The dataset is typically divided into training and validation sets to ensure the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.

After successful training, the CNN can be applied to new images, classifying them into one of the three severity levels. This automated classification system can be beneficial in dermatology and healthcare, providing a quick and objective assessment of acne severity. Such a tool could assist healthcare professionals in determining appropriate treatment plans and monitoring the progression of acne in patients.
